    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Neuro11 Therapeutics is a pioneering biotechnology company focused on unlocking the epigenetic frontier in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. With a deep commitment to scientific innovation and clinical impact, we are developing first-in-class HDAC11 inhibitors to treat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Our lead candidate, PB151, is a brain-penetrant, selective, and orally bioavailable compound engineered to precisely modulate gene expression without the off-target toxicity of broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors. By targeting neuroinflammation and epigenetic dysregulation, we aim to address the critical unmet need for safe, effective CNS therapies.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">Our Mission</h3>
        <p>At Neuro11, our mission is to transform the treatment landscape for CNS disorders by delivering precision-targeted, epigenetic-based therapies. We are driven by the belief that a deeper understanding of gene regulation and inflammation in the brain can unlock curative possibilities for conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and chronic pain. Our approach combines cutting-edge science, rigorous validation, and a commitment to translational impact to develop therapies that are not only effective but also accessible and well-tolerated</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">Future Plans</h3>
        <p> Neuro11 is advancing with a clear roadmap to clinical entry. In the near term, we aim to finalize candidate selection, complete IND-enabling studies, and submit our investigational new drug (IND) application to begin Phase 1 trials. Our long-term vision includes expanding our HDAC11 inhibitor platform into other indications such as Parkinson’s disease, chronic pain, and oncology. With scalable technology, strong IP, and a differentiated mechanism of action, we are poised to lead a new era of precision CNS therapeutics.
